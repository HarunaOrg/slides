# Risk Identification

What are problems or potential sources of problems?

*e.g.*:

- Security: outside threats, insider threats
- Relied Upon Services: upstream providers, CISL, Google, *etc.*
- Infrastructure: hardware, networking, power, HVAC
- Staff: sickness, departure
- Information: loss, disclosure

# Risk Assessment

For each risk:

- what is the estimated probability of risk occurring?
- what is the cost of risk occurring?
  - Financial: $$$
  - Social: organization's image, prestige, reputation

!SLIDE

# Risk Prioritization: Method 1

## Composite Risk Index

For each risk:

- impact: rate all risks on scale of 1 to 5
- index = probability * impact

!SLIDE

# Risk Prioritization: Method 2

- For each risk:
  - probabilty * cost
  - compare to cost of mitigation
    - mitigation == more expensive => acceptable risk
- Rank risks

# Addressing Risk

- Avoidance (eliminate, withdraw from or not become involved)
- Reduction (optimize -- mitigate)
- Sharing (transfer -- outsource or insure)
- Retention (accept and budget)
