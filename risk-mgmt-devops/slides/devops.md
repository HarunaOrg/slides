# DevOps

- portmanteau of *Development* and *Operations*.
- *agile of systems*
- best practices and tools to deal w/ cloud-scale and data-center deployments of servers, *ie.* *thousands* of servers
- values: **CAMS**
  - Culture
  - Automation
  - Metrics
  - Sharing
- [*treat servers as cattle, not pets*](http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2013/04/07/treating-servers-as-cattle-not-as-pets/)

# Version Control

- safety net that permits rollbacks
- *everything* is versioned
  - software
  - configurations
  - machine images
- accessible to developers and operations staff

!SLIDE

# Provisioning

- ensure that system has proper configuration (files, software, software versions, etc.) in automated fashion

- Provisioners:
  - Puppet
  - Chef
  - Salt
  - Ansible
  - Shell scripts (*ad hoc*)

<!-- developers and operations staff should be equally capable and confident in pushing updates (to dependencies, software, configuration) to operations -->

# Methods: Continuous Integration

QA Automation

> Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible.

!NOTE
CTM is not doing this, but would like to. SSG is doing this.

# Tools: Vagrant

> Create and configure lightweight, reproducible, and portable development environments.

# Tools: Vagrant

Package and manage VMs for many providers

- VirtualBox (from Oracle, for PCs)
- VMWare VSphere, Fusion, Workstation
- Hypervisor (MS)
- Amazon Web Services EC2
- OpenStack
- Digital Ocean

# Tools: Docker

- based on **LXC** (part of Linux kernel)

> Docker is an open-source engine to easily create lightweight, portable, self-sufficient containers from any application. The same container that a developer builds and tests on a laptop can run at scale, in production, on VMs, bare metal, OpenStack clusters, or any major infrastructure provider.

# Results: <=>

- Developers are able to quickly and reliably initialize development environments that mirror operations environments as closely as possible

- Operations staff are able to quickly and reliably initialize operational environments that mirror developments environments as closely as possible
