# Room For Improvement

- cross-repo issues: where do they issues belong?
- deployment collision-- surprise!
user friendly, can be surprising, in violation of PLOS, surprises in `ops` are bad
- application and assets out of sync while precompiling on deployment
- Scrum, less useful when staff are working on isolated tasks
- schema scattered across two repositories as Rails migrations and SQL files

!NOTE

- cross-repo issues: duplicate issues across repos, sacrifice private-repo
slot as meta repo for cross-repo issues?
- deployment collision: hasn't happened, handled gracefully by `git`, but not
user friendly, can be surprising, in violation of PLOS, surprises in `ops` are bad
- Scrum: isolated tasks, historically how our organization operates
