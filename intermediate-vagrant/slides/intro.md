#### Erik Johnson, NCAR EOL

#### NCAR EOL Prog Seminar

#### August 21, 2014

!NOTE
Many of you were @ the CDS Strategic Meeting in April when I provided and
introducetion to Vagrant , and CTM has been trying out Vagrant in our Field-
Catalog-development workflow since then. So, aside from some basics, I'll try
not to repeat too much of what I covered back in April and will share what we
have learned and our experience since then.

- 1 maintainer
- 3 users

  - **Field Catalog**

!NOTE
Mike Dye contributed to Field-Catalog development this spring and didn't have to
install all of the database and Ruby dependencies that traditionally go along w/
that-- he just installed VirtualBox, installed Vagrant, cloned our git
repository and started developing, which is The Way It Should Be.
