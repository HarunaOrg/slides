User-Agent inspection

      @@@ ruby
      def mobile_device?
        request.user_agent =~ /Mobile|webOS|Android/i
      end

      if mobile_device?
        # mobile-specific stuff
      end
 - *Screenshot CatalogMaps interfaces*
 - allow user to select other interface, store interface selection as cookie
 - not immune to User-Agent spoofing
