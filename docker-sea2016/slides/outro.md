# Lessons Learned
- `docker0` ethernet interface and `iptables`
- `$ docker run -it <image> bash`
- Lock versions
  - **Docker** images and installed software
  - `osm2pgsql` error
    - <https://github.com/geo-data/openstreetmap-tiles-docker/issues/18>
- See what's already out there, use or adapt to suit your needs
  - Build on existing images
  - Modify existing images by editing their `Dockerfile`s and building new images
- For **OSX**, **Docker Machine** isn't all the way there...

# Conclusions

- **Docker**: useful, mature, thriving ecosystem, works as advertisted
- Discards software-dependency resolution / dependency hell on different systems, **Linux** distributions
- Easy to simultaneously test and run different versions of software on same system
- **Docker Compose**: major enhancement to **Docker** user interface
- Different implementation patterns work, use according to your needs
- Just scratching the surface of **Docker**'s capabilities
- **Docker for Mac / Windows** should improve cross-platform usage

!NOTE
"different versions", epiphany: I was importing data using a previous version of software, while also simultaneously building and testing latest version of same software
