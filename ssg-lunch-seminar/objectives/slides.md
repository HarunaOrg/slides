# Catalog 2 Objectives

- use contemporary technologies and techniques
    - Field Catalog shouldn't look old and dated
    - off-load heavy lifting to third-party libraries and frameworks where possible
        - don't reinvent the wheel
        - lots of smart and talented folks have done this before and well

# Catalog 2 Objectives

- **DRY:** Don't Repeat Yourself

    - minimize / eliminate duplication of code
    - where possible, views should be write once, run anywhere:
        - don't write form-factor-specific views:
            - desktop
            - phone
            - tablet
        - write one view that responds to device form factor dynamically
