# The API Design Method

> This API design method consists of four steps:
> 
> - Descriptor: Review all the names of the data and action elements and, where needed, convert them into the names already understood in your API program.
> - Diagram: Convert your notes on workflow and internal cycles into something visual people can understand.
> - Definition: Create a machine-readable API definition document that developers can use as a starting point for their implementation.
> - Documentation: Write basic reference documentation for both service developers and service consumers (those using the API in the future).
